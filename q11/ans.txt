Importance of Layout Management

Layout management is essential in GUI development as it ensures that components are organized and displayed in a visually appealing and functional manner. The key reasons for needing layout management include:

Consistency: Layout managers provide a consistent look and feel across different platforms and screen sizes, ensuring that the GUI behaves predictably regardless of the environment.

Responsiveness: They allow for dynamic resizing and repositioning of components when the window is resized, enhancing user experience by maintaining usability.
