Types of Layout Managers
 1. FlowLayout
 Description: FlowLayout arranges components in a row, from left to right.
 When the container's width is exceeded, it wraps to the next line. This
 layout is ideal for simple interfaces where components should maintain their
 natural sizes.
 Usage: It is commonly used in panels where you want components to flow
 naturally without any specific positioning.
 2. BorderLayout
 Description: BorderLayout divides the container into five regions: NORTH,
 SOUTH, EAST, WEST, and CENTER. Each region can hold one component, which will
 expand to fill the available space.
 Usage: This layout is suitable for applications that need distinct sections,
 such as toolbars or status bars.
